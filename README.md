# 🎧 Music Behavior Analysis: Springfield vs. Shelbyville

## 📌 Overview
This project is a hands-on introduction to data analysis using Python and pandas. The main goal is to build fluency navigating dataframes through basic commands and simple loops.

## 🎯 Objective
Evaluate the hypothesis: User activity varies depending on the city and the day of the week.

## 📚 Educational Focus
* Basic dataframe navigation
* Use of `for` loops and methods like `.groupby()`, `.unique()`, `.dropna()`
* Application of conditional logic for exploratory analysis

🔍 Data Exploration
Initial review of the dataset to understand its structure.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
* Header formatting
* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Standardizing musical genre names

📊 Hypothesis Testing
* Comparing user activity by gender and city
* Evaluating listening patterns by day of the week

🛠️ Tools
`Pandas`

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

✅ Findings
📍 User activity does vary by city: Springfield represents 69.7% of all streams.

📅 No clear pattern based on the day of the week: Shelbyville peaks on Wednesdays, but Springfield remains steady.

🎓 Conclusion
This project helps reinforce skills in pandas and basic looping logic while exploring real-world music data. The analysis shows that location influences user behavior, but day of the week is not a consistent factor.
